#### Poisonous mushrooms

In this program, we explore the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of various supervised learning models.
Further, in the classification part, we create a model to detect if a given mushroom is poisonous or not.

Models used in this program:

- train_test_split
- LinearRegression
- PolynomialFeatures
- Lasso
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- SVC
- validation_curve

Libraries used in this program:

- pandas
- numpy
